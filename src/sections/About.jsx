            I'm an undergraduate student with a strong interest in building impactful software solutions that merge technology and creativity. My journey began with a curiosity for how things work, which naturally led me to the world of coding. Whether itâ€™s crafting responsive websites, developing smart IoT systems, or exploring AI integration, I love turning ideas into reality. Beyond the screen, I enjoy exploring new places, learning from different cultures, and drawing inspiration from the world around me. I believe in continuous growth and using technology to make a meaningful difference.
